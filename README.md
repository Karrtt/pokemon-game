#Pokemon game using React and PokeAPI

Project Description:
PokeMatch is an interactive React web application that offers a set of two mini-games designed for Pokemon lovers. By leveraging the PokeAPI, this project provides a delightful experience, inviting users to test their knowledge and memory.

Game 1: "Guess the Pokemon"
The objective of this mini-game is to challenge players to correctly identify a Pokemon's image based on its corresponding name. The user is presented with a Pokemon name and four distinct images. The task is to observe the images and selct the correct one that corresponds to the provided Pokemon name. A timer is also integrated into the game to add a sense of urgency to the challenge.

Game 2: "PokeMatch Memory Game"
The PokeMatch Memory Game is a classic memory challenge, enriched with a Pokemon-themed twist. The player is presented with a grid of facedown cards, each concealing a hidden Pokemon image. The ultimate goal is to locate pairs of cards that depict the same Pokemon by flipping them over two at a time. 

This project was built with Vite React and uses PokeAPI to get the data. 
The project is running live on https://karrtt.netlify.app/.
